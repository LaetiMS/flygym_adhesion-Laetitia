These are the state of the joints (angular position, velocity, force) and of the fly (cartesian position and orientation of the thorax in the arena). Precisely, the `'joints'` array has a shape of (3, num_dofs). The 0th, 1st, and 2nd rows are the angular position, velocity, and force at each DoF. The ordering is the same as `nmf.actuated_joints`. The `'fly'` array has a shape of (4, 3). The 0th and 1st rows are the cartesian position and velocity of the fly in the arena in x, y, z directions (taking measurement from the thorax). The 2nd and 3rd rows are the orientation (rotation) of the fly along each axis, and the rate of change thereof.\n","\n","Second, note that the joint position here is determined by a sine function. You can replace this line with anything—a neural network, a set of differential equations or a group of if-statements (although you might want to encapsulate it into a function for readability). The simulation environment is agnostic to the controller.\n","\n","Third, if you want a video to be rendered, you should call the `.render()` method in every iteration. The simulation runs at a very high frequency (by default 1000Hz) while the rendering is much slower (by default 60FPS) so not all frames need to be actually rendered. Don't worry, the `.render()` method will figure it out by itself; you just need to call it every step.\n","\n","It is critical to call the `.close()` method at the end. Otherwise certain resources won't be released, and the rendered video won't be saved.\n","\n","Finally, the environment can optionally return additional information (`info`). This is by default just an empty dictionary, but you can extend the `NeuroMechFlyMuJoCo` class to implement it in any way you want.\n","\n","The rendered video is saved under `out_dir`.
